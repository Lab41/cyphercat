Here are tools and software you can use to replicate our work.

## Research

We are focusing on two different areas of research, aiming to contribute to the CleverHans repository. These areas are:
- *Model inversion* attack is the process of either the model parameters or the data used to train the data.
- *Model Fooling/Evasion* attacks are related to tricking a model into performing considerably worse on basic examples

The below is created by our visualization software. The actual PDF has links to the arxiv papers.

## Environment and Software

### Visualization

We are using [GraphViz](https://www.graphviz.org/) for our research in order to get a handle on the papers in the space, as well as describe our research. You can view some of that here. To install visualization tools via Mac, use:

```
brew install graphviz
pip install graphviz
```
